This is a simple project that reads a sentence character by character
and calculates:

- Total number of characters
- Number of words
- Number of vowels

## How it works

The algorithm uses counters for:
- `length` for character count,
- `word_count` for counting words (space-separated),
- `vowel_count` for counting vowels (a, e, i, o, u).

The sentence must end with a period `.`
